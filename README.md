# RevertedDiscord
So this is a themes/CSS code that I cobbled together from specific pieces of OldCord code and other code snippets available on the web.

Below are the results (light mode vs dark mode)!

Minor issue in that the inbox and ?/help buttons are no longer visible as part of compressing the top bar so that it isn't in the way, and the close, minimize, full screen buttons overlap with the discord logo (and might not be visible for some?).

If you're interested in using, add
```
@import url("https://smalltweaks.github.io/RevertedDiscordUI/");
```
into your quick CSS editor.

The individual code pieces (it's messy looking, sorry, not sure how to fix that) can be found at the URL if you just want to tweak or use pieces of it.
